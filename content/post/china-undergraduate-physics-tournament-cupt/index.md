I have been participating in preparing for CUPT for about 2 years. During this time I've got a lot of experience and skills about this tournament. Now I'd like to share my documents as reference for students who are willing to participate in this tournament. You can also ask me questions by [sending emails](mailto:wby0823@mail.ustc.edu.cn)
