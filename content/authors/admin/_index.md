I was born in a family full of love in August, 2001. Since then I've always been fascinated by science and technology and wish I could devote myself to these areas.

I began to study in University of Science and Technology of China since 2019 as an undergraduate student majors in Physical Science. I wish I could apply what I've learned to my life and my career in the future.
